    Statement: 
    
    Images pass through my mind to varying degrees of clarity and confusion. Some come into focus unexpectedly, bringing with them astonishment, despite the nearly invisible traces left in my current life. In my paintings, I seek to render those imperfect, yet emotional simulacra. Recollection seems to me to be similar to thinking, in general: the subject perceived is sketched out in the mind using memories, both fictional and real, to form an idea. Certain details remain specific while others are lost, written over; anonymous and arbitrary. I seek to replicate that process though paint and drawing.

I am motivated to record something that is transient and perishable; states that did not even exist materially in the first place. Despite often being based on real moments, specifically those recorded by photographs, I am not concerned with the complete accuracy of my representation in paint, but rather interested in rendering my impressions and the way that my mind visualizes. I superimpose various types of brushstrokes and shift perspective to travel in-between dimensions in the same image, and engage a limited color palette which corresponds to the hue of the moment in my mind.
